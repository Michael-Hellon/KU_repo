      <p style="width: 600px;"> Hello! I am Michael Hellon. I am looking forward to becoming a Web Devoloper/
        Full-Stack Software Engineer. I will be retiring in July, from the US Army after 20 years of faithfull service.
        I have been to Iraq twice, Afghanistan and Europe once. In 2010 I was selected to go to the US Army Air Assualt 
        School and then US Army Pathfinder School. They were meantally and physically the toughest schools I have been too.  
      </p>
      <p style="width: 600px;">My future plans include traveling to Alaska, Europe and Japan. I also plan on learning Python, 
        C++ and C# amoung other programming languages. I woyuld like to use my programming knowledge to build wearable tech 
        for the US Military. I have two wonderful teenagers, one still in high school and one deciding on college. My Wife 
        and I have 3 cats, Gracie, Howie and Carrot.
